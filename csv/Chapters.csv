0,The Effects of Urbanization in Wake County,media/nlcd.jpg, , ,"<p>Wake County is one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States. Estimates say that about 56 people move to Wake County each day. Technological, educational, and industrial benefits all are huge draws for the area.</p><p>The drawbacks of such rapid growth are effects that it has on people who are less affluent than the people who are moving into the county for work. Many people who have lived their entire lives in Wake County are being driven out of larger urban hubs like Raleigh and Cary because they can no longer afford to live in their homes.They are being forced to move farther into the outer portions of the county (and in some cases, into neighboring counties like Harnett and Johnston).</p>",10.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,1.0,geojson/wakewdata.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
1,Ways to Improve City Building,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFjD3NMv6Kw&ab_channel=TED,TEDTalks ,http://www.ted.com,"More than half of the world's population already lives in cities, and another 2.5 billion people are projected to move to urban areas by 2050. The way we build new cities will be at the heart of so much that matters, from climate change to economic vitality to our very well-being and sense of connectedness. Peter Calthorpe is already at work planning the cities of the future and advocating for community design that's focused on human interaction. He shares seven universal principles for solving sprawl and building smarter, more sustainable cities.",15.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,1.0,, 
2,Black Homeownership in Wake County,"media/Percent of Black Homeowners in Wake County, NC.png", , ,"<p>While homeownership numbers are important data points to have, sums can oftentimes tell incomplete stories. To combat this, I decided to calculate the percentage of Black homeowners. This was accomplished by dividing the total number of Black homeowners by the total number of homeowners in a particular tract.</p><p>Eastern Wake County (Southeast Raleigh especially) has some of the largest percentages of Black homeowners per census tract in the entire county. </p>",11.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,1.0,geojson/wakewdata.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
3,Annual Income Distribution in Wake County,"media/Average Annual Household Income Distribution in Wake County, NC.png", , ,"<p>That same area (Southeast Raleigh) also appeared to be the least affluent area of Wake County. However, visual inspections and interpretations can be misleading. It isnâ€™t possible to tell the exact classification of each of color on the scale, so one can only make generalizations about homeownership and income. </p><p>Further analysis was needed to determine any potential correlation between the two variables. </p>",11.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,1.0,geojson/wakewdata.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
4,Correlation Between Annual Income and Black Homeownership in Wake County,"media/Correlation Between Average Annual Household Income and Percentage of Black Homeowners in Wake County, NC.png", , ,"<p>I decided to use thr Pearson correlation coefficient to determine if there was any relation between annual household income and the percentage of Black homeowners.</p><p>The calculated Pearson correlation coefficient came out to be negative 0.476. This means that (generally) as the average annual household income increases, the percentage of Black homeowners decreases. Negative 0.476 means there is a moderate negative correlation. </p>",10.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,1.0,geojson/wakewdata.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
